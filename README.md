# LexiconProj

* A java project that focuses on the usage of a trie data structure to implement a Lexicon. Essentially, the tree with n children stores words, with each letter being a node. The point of this is quick access and minimal space usage. Key functions include matchRegex which lets us find words following certain patterns in the trie, and suggestCorrections, which, in a microsoft-word like fashion, suggests corrections to a user's word based on the words stored in the Lexicon.
